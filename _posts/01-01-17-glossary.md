* **Basin of attraction**: A set of points (initial conditions) in the phase space from which a dynamical system spontaneously moves to a particular attractor.

* **Bifurcation**: A sudden qualitative change in the behaviour of a dynamical system given a small change in the system parameter values. A critical bifurcation can be indicative of a significant positive or negative transition between steady-states. 

* **Dilution rate**: Inflow of substrate, nutrient or medium per volume of reactor or culture.

* **Eigenvalue**: The value of a parameter for which a differential equation has a non-zero solution for given conditions. Used to determine the stability of fixed-points from the Jacobian of the ODEs.

* **Fixed-point**: The fixed-point of a function is such that it maps to itself in the functional domain, e.g. for a function f(x), p is a fixed-point if f(p) = p. In stability theory for dynamical systems, fixed-points can represent equilibrium positions in a autonomous system of differential equations (i.e., f(x) = 0). Stability may be determined by examining the response to small perturbations from the fixed-points.

* **Gibbs Free Energy**: The energy associated with a chemical reaction that can be used to do work. A negative Gibbs Free Energy (\Delta G) indicates a favourable reaction can (spontaneously) take place depending on temperature.

* **Jacobian Matrix**: A matrix of first-order partial differential equations of a set of a vector function (i.e., in MI-SIM, the vector of model ODEs). Eigenvalues of the Jacobian determine the behaviour of trajectories close to the system equilibria (fixed-points). These trajectories can be thought of as perturbations in the parameter space containing the fixed-points. The trajectories, evaluated as a function of time, will determine if the equilibria are stable or unstable.
