* **Basin of attraction** A set of points (initial conditions) in the phase space from which a dynamical system spontaneously moves to a particular attractor
* **Bifurcation** A sudden qualitative change in the behaviour of a dynamical system given a small change in the system parameter values. A critical bifurcation can be indicative of a significant positive or negative transition between steady-states. 
* **Dilution rate** Inflow of substrate, nutrient or medium per volume of reactor or culture
* **Eigenvalue** The value of a parameter for which a differential equation has a non-zero solution for given conditions. Used to determine the stability of fixed-points from the Jacobian of the ODEs
* **Fixed-point** The fixed-point of a function is such that it maps to itself in the functional domain, e.g. for a function f(x), p is a fixed-point if f(p) = p. In stability theory for dynamical systems, fixed-points can represent equilibrium positions in a autonomous system of differential equations (i.e., f(x) = 0). Stability may be determined by examining the response to small perturbations from the fixed-points.
