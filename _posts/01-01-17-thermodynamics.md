## Description

This module is available upon selection of the *thermodynamics* growth model from the <span style="font-family:Courier;">MI-Sim</span>
interface. At present, the thermodynamics is modelled only for the inhibition function, $I_2$, applicable to the cooperation/syntrophy and
three-species motifs. The growth model functions, $f_n$, default to Monod form in all cases. Furthermore, thermodynamic inhibition only has meaning 
in microbial systems and should not be used for interactions at higher trophic scales.
