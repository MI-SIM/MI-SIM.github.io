# <span style="font-family:Courier;">MI-Sim</span>

<span style="font-family:Courier;">MI-Sim</span> is a <span style="font-family:Courier;">MATLAB</span> graphical user-interface whose main function is the numerical analysis of dynamical systems describing ecological
interactions (motifs). It's principal features are: 

* Dynamical simulation of seven ecological motifs
* Analysis of existence and stability of steady-states for single and multiple point parameter spaces
* Basin of attraction and phase portrait analysis to understand the influence of initial conditions of steady-state attractors
* Multiple plotting tools to visualise the analysis results
* Reporting functionality 

Future versions of the software will include:

* Capacity to develop and analyse user-defined motifs
* Sensitivity analysis tools
